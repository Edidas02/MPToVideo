2. We have chosen the LiveDataLab System. We plan on addressing the subtopic of linking MP descriptions to the corresponding lecture videos in Coursera.
3. For datasets, we plan on using general text document retrieval datasets to make sure our algorithm works properly. On testing, we will use the Coursera video transcripts as well as the provided MP descriptions.  For the algorithm, we plan on using TF-IDF based algorithms, Latent Semantic Analysis methods, and Word Embeddings models.
4. To test if our function works, we will use MP descriptions and manually check if the linked videos it finds is relevant to the MP.
5. Our code will read the MP description and then find the matching video to guide the user to.
6. Python
7. Our workload will be at least 40 hours due to these reasons. The backend portion of our code will take at least 20 hours. This is because we need to create a working algorithm based on the methods we have listed above that is unique to our purpose. Unit testing and debugging this algorithm will take at least 15 hours as we need to modify parameters as well as fix any logical issues in our algorithm for it to fully function correctly. We also need to manually check if the results are accurate since we do not have a readily available testing dataset. Finding relevant text document retrieval datasets to train on will take around 5 hours.
